# SpeedyRoute


## Overview

This project is a web application designed to display the shortest path between any two places within IIT Guwahati. It utilizes a weighted-undirected graph where each intersection is treated as a node, and the shortest path is calculated using Dijkstra's Algorithm. The front-end of the application is built with React, while the back-end, responsible for the pathfinding algorithm, is implemented in Python.


## Features 

* Interactive map of IIT Guwahati.
* Displays the shortest path between selected start and end points.
* Utilizes Dijkstra's Algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
* Responsive and user-friendly interface.




## Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm installed.
* Python installed.
* Basic knowledge of React and Python.

## Usage

* Open the React app in your browser.
* You will see a map of IIT Guwahati.
* Select the start and end points on the map.
* Click on the "Find Path" button to display the shortest path between the two points.

## Example

* If you entered your starting point 2 and ending point 51 then it will show you the path with shortest distance from the sorce i.e. 2 to destination i.e. 51.
